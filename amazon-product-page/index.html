        <h4>The cats of America are under siege!</h4>
        <p>Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath.         Modern cats must confront satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to 
        survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, 
        and countless other threats to their nine lives.</p>
        <p>For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at the 
        vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the 
        difficult conversations they dread having with their pets.</p>
        <p>Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety answers 
        crucial questions such as, “What is the right age to talk to my cat about the proper 
        use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits of my cat living a lifestyle of abstinence?” 
        and especially “Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he just play with yarn 
        like cats used to do?”</p>
        <p>America - and our cats - stand at a precipice. It will take courage, and it will take 
        hard work, but armed with the knowledge within these pages, we can make our cats - 
        and America - great again!</p>
